If\n *     `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to\n *     render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.\n *\n *   retry: ?Function\n *     A function that can be called to re-attempt to fulfill data dependencies.\n *     This property is only present if an `error` has occurred.\n *\n *   stale: boolean\n *     When `forceFetch` is enabled, a request is always made to fetch updated\n *     data. However, if all data dependencies can be immediately fulfilled, the\n *     `props` property will be present. In this case, `stale` will be true.\n *\n * The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last\n * view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).\n *\n * If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the\n * container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by the `render` callback can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...props} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted.
