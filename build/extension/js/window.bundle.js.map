It encodes the source fragment, initial variables, and\n\t * a mapping from variables in the composing query's (or fragment's) scope to\n\t * variables in the fragment's scope.\n\t *\n\t * The variable mapping is represented by `variableMapping`, a dictionary that\n\t * maps from names of variables in the parent scope to variables that exist in\n\t * the fragment. Example:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * // Fragment:\n\t * var Container = Relay.createContainer(..., {\n\t *   initialVariables: {\n\t *     private: 'foo',\n\t *     public: 'bar',\n\t *     variable: null,\n\t *   },\n\t *   fragments: {\n\t *     foo: ...\n\t *   }\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * // Reference:\n\t * ${Container.getQuery(\n\t *   'foo',\n\t *   // Variable Mapping:\n\t *   {\n\t *     public: 'BAR',\n\t *     variable: variables.source,\n\t *   }\n\t * )}\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When evaluating the referenced fragment, `$public` will be overridden with\n\t * `'Bar'`. The value of `$variable` will become the value of `$source` in the\n\t * outer scope. This is analagous to:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * function inner(private = 'foo', public = 'bar', variable) {}\n\t * function outer(source) {\n\t *   inner(public = 'BAR', variable = source);\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Where the value of the inner `variable` depends on how `outer` is called.\n\t *\n\t * The `prepareVariables` function allows for variables to be modified based on\n\t * the runtime environment or route name.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar RelayFragmentReference = (function () {\n\t  RelayFragmentReference.createForContainer = function createForContainer(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables) {\n\t    var reference = new RelayFragmentReference(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables);\n\t    reference._isContainerFragment = true;\n\t    return reference;\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  function RelayFragmentReference(fragmentGetter, initialVariables, variableMapping, prepareVariables) {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, RelayFragmentReference);\n\t\n\t    this._initialVariables = initialVariables || {};\n\t    this._fragment = undefined;\n\t    this._fragmentGetter = fragmentGetter;\n\t    this._isContainerFragment = false;\n\t    this._isDeferred = false;\n\t    this._variableMapping = variableMapping;\n\t    this._prepareVariables = prepareVariables;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Mark this usage of the fragment as deferred.\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  RelayFragmentReference.prototype.defer = function defer() {\n\t    this._isDeferred = true;\n\t    return this;\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Mark this fragment for inclusion only if the given variable is truthy.\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  RelayFragmentReference.prototype['if'] = function _if(value) {\n\t    var callVariable = QueryBuilder.getCallVariable(value);\n\t    !callVariable ?  false ? invariant(false, 'RelayFragmentReference: Invalid value `%s` supplied to `if()`.

If\n *     `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to\n *     render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.\n *\n *   retry: ?Function\n *     A function that can be called to re-attempt to fulfill data dependencies.\n *     This property is only present if an `error` has occurred.\n *\n *   stale: boolean\n *     When `forceFetch` is enabled, a request is always made to fetch updated\n *     data. However, if all data dependencies can be immediately fulfilled, the\n *     `props` property will be present. In this case, `stale` will be true.\n *\n * The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last\n * view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).\n *\n * If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the\n * container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by the `render` callback can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...props} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted.
